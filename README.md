-I’m Oussema, a software engineer based in Tunisia.
​
-I design and build web apps and backend services that are fast, reliable, and easy to use.

-If an idea turns into a useful tool or feature, chances are I’ll prototype it, refine it, and ship it.
​
-My main tech stack is React, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and I also work with Python and C++.
Recently, I built:
​
-A project management platform (MERN) with real-time tickets, chat, and role-based access that cut ticket update time by about 40%.​
-An e-commerce site for 50+ products with search, cart, and secure checkout that improved product load times by around 30%.

-I’m currently in the Software Engineering program at École Polytechnique Sousse after earning my bachelor’s there with honors.
​
-If you want to see how I build things, my projects are on GitHub and LinkedIn.
